intro: |
 I am a computer science graduate currently working in technology. I primarily have experience working as a front-end developer but have worked across a broad range of tenchologies: NodeJs, ElectronJs and also 
 AngularJs. As well as a considerable amount of experience on Amazon Web Service(AWS).
 <br/><br/>
 I enjoy building a simple yet powerful codes. I believe good codes are those that are simple to understand yet powerful enough to do complexe tasks.
